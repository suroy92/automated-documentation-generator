### Class: `PasswordManager`
**Description:** * Manages password operations including generation, storage, retrieval, modification, deletion, and migration using a NeDB database.

#### Method: `constructor()`
**Description:** * Creates an instance of the class and initializes its database. Sets up a NeDB Datastore instance for managing passwords, configured to load automatically from 'passwords.db'.

**Returns** (void):
  */

#### Method: `generateSecurePassword(length, includeNumbers = true, includeSymbols = false)`
**Description:** * Generates a secure random password based on specified length and character sets. The password will always include alphabetic characters.
 *

**Returns** (string):
  The randomly generated secure password.
 */

#### Method: `storePassword(data)`
**Description:** * Stores encrypted password data into the database. The data object is processed to include a current date and recovery codes are formatted before insertion.
 *

**Parameters:**
  - `data` (object): The password data to be stored.
  - `data.title` (string): The title or name for the password entry.
  - `data.username` (string): The username associated with the password.
  - `data.password` (string): The actual password to be stored.
  - `[data.recoveryCodes]` (string): Optional comma-separated string of recovery codes. These will be stored as a comma-separated string.

**Returns** (Promise<object>):
  A Promise that resolves with the newly inserted document (newDoc) upon successful storage, or rejects with an error (err).
 */

#### Method: `listPasswords()`
**Description:** * Retrieves a list of all password entry metadata (excluding sensitive password data) from the database. Each entry includes its ID, title, and creation date.
 *

**Returns** (Promise<Array<{_id: string, title: string, date: Date):
  >>} A Promise that resolves with an array of   password metadata objects. Each object contains the _id (string), title (string),   and date (Date object or string representation) of the password entry. @rejects {Error} If there is an error accessing the database.
 */

#### Method: `getPasswordDetails(id)`
**Description:** * Retrieves detailed information for a specific password entry from the database. This method fetches a password entry by its unique identifier. If found, it resolves with an object containing the entry's details. If the password entry is not found or a database error occurs, the Promise will be rejected.
 *

**Returns** (Promise<object>):
  A Promise that resolves with an object containing the password details.          The resolved object typically has the following properties:          - _id: {string} The unique ID of the password entry.          - title: {string} The title or name associated with the password entry.          - username: {string} The username for the account.          - password: {string} The actual password string (assumed to be decrypted if stored encrypted).          - recoveryCodes: {string|string[]|null} Any recovery codes associated with the entry. The type can vary.          - date: {Date|string} The creation or last update date of the entry (can be a Date object or an ISO string). @rejects {Error} If the password entry is not found (e.g., 'Password not found') or a database error occurs.
 */

#### Method: `editPassword(id)`
**Description:** * Initiates the process for editing a user's password. This function returns a Promise that will resolve or reject based on the outcome of the password editing operation.
 *

**Returns** (Promise<void>):
  A promise that resolves when the password editing process is successfully completed, or rejects if an error occurs.
 */

#### Method: `deletePassword(id)`
**Description:** * Deletes a password entry from the database based on its unique ID. This method wraps the database removal operation in a Promise.
 *

**Returns** (Promise<number>):
  A Promise that resolves with the number of documents removed (typically 0 or 1).                            Rejects with an error if the database operation fails.
 */

#### Method: `migrateUp(records)`
**Description:** * Migrates a collection of records to a new format by adding a current date and inserts them into the database. Each record in the input array is mapped to a new object, adding a 'date' field with the current date formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD' using the moment library. The mapped records are then inserted into the database. This operation is asynchronous and returns a Promise.
 *

**Returns** (Promise<string>):
  A Promise that resolves with the string 'Migration completed' upon successful   insertion of records, or rejects with an error if the database insertion fails.
 */

#### Method: `migrateDown()`
**Description:** * Reverts the current migration by removing all records from the database. This operation effectively "rolls back" the database state.
 *

**Returns** (Promise<string>):
  A promise that resolves with a success message indicating the number of records removed,   or rejects with an error if the removal operation fails.
 */

#### Method: `export()`
**Description:** * Exports all documents from the database to a JSON file named 'Exported.json'. The file is written synchronously to the root directory where the application is run.
 *

**Returns** (Promise<string>):
  A Promise that resolves with a success message string if the export is successful,                            or rejects with an error if the database query fails or the file cannot be written.
